I am a PhD student at [LIMSI](https://www.limsi.fr/en/) and University Paris-Saclay, under the supervision of [Alexandre Allauzen](https://allauzen.github.io/). My PhD is funded by [Societe Generale](https://www.societegenerale.com/en).

My research work lies between statistics, natural language processing and machine learning. My PhD thesis aims to design models capturing the evolution of language. 
I am especially fond of working with time series! And currently looking for a post-doc starting early 2021.
