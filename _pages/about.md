My research work lies between statistics, natural language processing and machine learning.
Since 2023, I am a post-doctoral researcher at EPFL, in the [NLP lab](https://nlp.epfl.ch/), under the supervision of [Antoine Bosselut](https://atcbosselut.github.io/). Among other topics, I work on vision-language models towards [Knowledge-guided Explanations for Satellite Images](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/eceo/eceo/projects/572-2/) and on commonsense reasoning.

In 2022, I was an invited researcher at Jozef Stefan Institute (JSI) in Ljubjana, Slovenia; working on multi-task learning and causal discovery.
Before JSI, I did a post-doc at INRIA Paris, in the [Almanach Team](http://almanach.inria.fr/), designing models to detect hateful content in social media posts and memes; the focus was on multimodal models, cross-lingual transfer and temporal graph modeling for social networks.

I did my PhD at [LISN](https://www.limsi.fr/en/) and University Paris-Saclay, under the supervision of [Alexandre Allauzen](https://allauzen.github.io/), on computational models of diachronic semantic change. I worked mostly on historical text data, news and social media, and focused on low-resource corpora and cross-lingual semantic change.
Despite moving to other topics with my successive post-docs, I'm still active in the sematic change community, co-organizing the LChange workshop on Historical Language Change since two years.
