My research work lies between statistics, natural language processing and machine learning.

I did my PhD at [LISN](https://www.limsi.fr/en/) and University Paris-Saclay, under the supervision of [Alexandre Allauzen](https://allauzen.github.io/), on computational models of diachronic semantic change. I worked on historical data, social media

I am now a post-doctoral researcher at INRIA Paris, in the [Almanach Team](http://almanach.inria.fr/), designing models to detect radicalisation in social media.
