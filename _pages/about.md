My research work lies between statistics, natural language processing and machine learning.

I did my PhD at [LISN](https://www.limsi.fr/en/) and University Paris-Saclay, under the supervision of [Alexandre Allauzen](https://allauzen.github.io/), on computational models of diachronic semantic change. I worked mostly on historical text data, news and social media, and focused on low-resource corpora and cross-lingual semantic change.

I did a post-doc at INRIA Paris, in the [Almanach Team](http://almanach.inria.fr/), designing models to detect hateful content in social media posts and memes; the focus was on multimodal models and cross-lingual transfer.

Since June 2022, I'm an invited researcher at Jozef Stefan Institute in Ljubjana, Slovenia; working on multi-task learning and causal discovery.
I'm looking for my next post-doc!
